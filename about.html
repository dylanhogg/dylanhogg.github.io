<p>Hi there ðŸ‘‹, thanks for visiting. I'm a dad, husband, software engineer and data guy interested in technology and its impact on our society.</p>

<p>So far most content here is in a bunch of <a href="/apps">applications I've built and deployed</a> that you can check out, however I plan to blog more (it's Oct 2021 now, so let's see).</p>

<p>I really dig this Wait But Why graphic and recommend reading the <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html">AI Revolution</a> post it came from.</p>
