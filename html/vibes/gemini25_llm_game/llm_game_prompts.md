# A Developer’s Guide to LLM Agents

## What Is an LLM Agent?

The term “agent” gets used in different ways, so it’s important to define what _we_ mean by an **LLM agent** in this context. Let’s look at a few definitions from 2024–2025 to see both the **common threads and differing perspectives**:

- **Anthropic (Dec 2024):** Anthropic uses _“agentic systems”_ as an umbrella term for systems where an LLM is integrated into a broader loop. They distinguish between **workflows** (LLMs + tools orchestrated by predefined code paths) and **agents** (LLMs that _dynamically_ decide how to use tools and how to accomplish the task) ([Building Effective AI Agents \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents#:~:text=What%20are%20agents%3F)). In other words, if the steps are hard-coded by a developer, it’s a _workflow_; if the LLM itself decides the steps, it’s an _agent_. Anthropic notes some people use “agent” to mean a fully autonomous system running long-term, while others mean simply any LLM-based process following a script ([Building Effective AI Agents \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents#:~:text=,distinction%20between%20workflows%20and%20agents)). Their view encapsulates all these as agentic systems but emphasizes whether the control flow is dictated by code (workflow) or by the LLM’s own logic (agent) ([Building Effective AI Agents \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents#:~:text=various%20tools%20to%20accomplish%20complex,distinction%20between%20workflows%20and%20agents)). An agent, in this sense, is characterized by **flexibility** and _model-driven decision-making_ instead of a fixed procedure.

- **Chip Huyen (Jan 2025):** In her _AI Engineering_ book section on Agents, Chip Huyen goes back to the classic AI definition: _“An agent is anything that can perceive its environment and act upon that environment.”_ ([Agents](https://huyenchip.com/2025/01/07/agents.html#:~:text=An%20agent%20is%20anything%20that,upon%20that%20environment%20through%20actuators)) This is the broad definition from Russell and Norvig’s AI textbook. Applied to LLMs, Chip defines an AI agent by the **environment it operates in** and the **actions (tools) it can perform** ([Agents](https://huyenchip.com/2025/01/07/agents.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L1052%20At%20its,Access%20to%20tools)). In an LLM-powered agent, _“the AI model is the brain that leverages its tools and feedback from the environment to plan how best to accomplish a task.”_ ([Agents](https://huyenchip.com/2025/01/07/agents.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L1052%20At%20its,Access%20to%20tools)) So Chip’s definition highlights that an agent isn’t just the LLM – it’s an **LLM + tools + environment + feedback loop**, with the LLM making decisions. Notably, she suggests agency is a _spectrum_, not a binary: you can give an LLM _more or less influence_ over the program’s execution ([Introducing smolagents: simple agents that write actions in code.](https://huggingface.co/blog/smolagents#:~:text=AI%20Agents%20are%20programs%20where,LLM%20outputs%20control%20the%20workflow)). A simple QA bot has almost no agency (it just answers); an AutoGPT-like system has a lot of agency (it can decide to call many tools and when to stop).

- **Hugging Face (smolrobots, Dec 2024):** The Hugging Face team introduced _smolagents_ with the description: _“AI Agents are programs where LLM outputs control the workflow.”_ ([Introducing smolagents: simple agents that write actions in code.](https://huggingface.co/blog/smolagents#:~:text=AI%20Agents%20are%20programs%20where,LLM%20outputs%20control%20the%20workflow)) If the LLM’s response influences what the code does next, that’s agentic behavior. They too emphasize a spectrum of agency – from an LLM whose output is ignored (no agency), to one where outputs route the program, to one that can iteratively decide actions and even launch other agents ([Introducing smolagents: simple agents that write actions in code.](https://huggingface.co/blog/smolagents#:~:text=Agency%20Level%20Description%20How%20that%27s,step%20Agent%20%60while%20llm_should_continue%28%29%3A%20execute_next_step)). The key theme: giving more **control** to the LLM over the program flow increases its agency. A fully autonomous agent might even run in a loop and spawn sub-agents, whereas a partial agent just picks which function to call next. The HF team encourages using the minimal level of agency necessary – for reliability, don’t unleash an agent if a simple deterministic script suffices ([Introducing smolagents: simple agents that write actions in code.](https://huggingface.co/blog/smolagents#:~:text=Agents%20are%20useful%20when%20you,on%20a%20surfing%20trip%20website)) ([Introducing smolagents: simple agents that write actions in code.](https://huggingface.co/blog/smolagents#:~:text=search%20your%20knowledge%20base%202,type%20in%20a%20contact%20form)).

Despite varying wording, these definitions **converge** on a core idea: **an LLM agent couples an LLM with actions in an environment, such that the LLM’s outputs influence what the system does.** An agent perceives (reads input or observations) and acts (produces outputs that cause real actions via tools or APIs). It has a loop of _sense-think-act_. In contrast, a plain LLM is just a stateless mapper from prompt to completion.

Where definitions **diverge** is mainly in scope and autonomy. Is a single-turn QA with a tool call an “agent”? Some say yes (it has tool use, thus agentic); others reserve “agent” for systems that _continue autonomously over multiple steps_. In this guide, we’ll lean towards the latter: an LLM agent typically implies a system that can operate for multiple steps, making decisions along the way, not just a one-off tool invocation.

**Core Components of an LLM Agent:** Across the various definitions and implementations, a few **building blocks** show up repeatedly as essential parts of an LLM agent:

- **LLM (Language Model):** The reasoning engine or “brain” of the agent, responsible for deciding what to do next. This could be GPT-4, Claude, PaLM, Llama 2, etc. The LLM generates the next _action_ or _plan_ given the current state and prompt.
- **Tools/Actions:** Functions the agent can execute to affect the world or retrieve information. These could be search engines, calculators, databases, code interpreters, or any API. The agent chooses tools to call to help it progress. In a sense, tools are the agent’s **actuators** or effectors on the environment ([Building Effective AI Agents \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents#:~:text=,distinction%20between%20workflows%20and%20agents)) ([Agents](https://huyenchip.com/2025/01/07/agents.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L1052%20At%20its,Access%20to%20tools)).
- **Memory/State:** A mechanism to persist information across steps. This can include the conversation history (short-term memory), an **episodic memory** of recent important events, and possibly a **long-term memory** (stored in a vector database or other knowledge store). Memory is the agent’s way to **remember context** beyond the LLM’s fixed window ([Comparing OpenAI Swarm with other Multi Agent Frameworks - Arize AI](https://arize.com/blog/comparing-openai-swarm/#:~:text=Swarm%20introduces%20a%20unique%20memory,up%20across%20the%20three%20frameworks)) ([Comparing OpenAI Swarm with other Multi Agent Frameworks - Arize AI](https://arize.com/blog/comparing-openai-swarm/#:~:text=Autogen%3A%20Offers%20a%20similar%20memory,key%20terms%20and%20memories%20automatically)). Without memory, an agent would forget prior tool outputs or its own plans.
- **Planner/Reasoner:** Some agents explicitly separate out a planning module – a component that generates a high-level plan or sequence of actions (this could itself be an LLM prompt or a separate process). In many implementations the LLM does planning implicitly (e.g. via chain-of-thought prompting). But broadly, an agent needs a way to decide **which sub-tasks or actions** to do in what order. This could involve techniques like ReAct or others we’ll discuss in the next section.
- **Controller/Orchestrator:** There is often a piece of code that orchestrates the loop – feeding the LLM its observations, invoking the tool the LLM requested, then feeding the result back, etc. In some frameworks this controller is minimal (just a `while` loop around the LLM), in others it’s more elaborate (managing multiple agents, scheduling tasks, handling errors). The orchestrator ensures the **agent’s cycle** runs and may enforce constraints (like “stop after N steps” or safety checks).
- **Policy/Heuristics:** Beyond the pure LLM, many agents include rules or heuristics – e.g. a hard limit on iterations, or a filter to prevent dangerous actions, or a reward function to decide when done. This part is not always highlighted, but in practice, successful agents often need a bit of hard-coded policy to keep them on track (prevent infinite loops, avoid obviously bad outputs, etc.).

To summarize, an LLM agent is an **augmented LLM** – the LLM is augmented with tools, memory, and a loop structure that lets it **plan and execute actions** autonomously. If a plain LLM is a car engine, an LLM agent is a full self-driving car: engine + steering + memory of the route + sensors + wheels on the road. It’s a complex integration of components to achieve autonomy.

## How LLMs Enable Agents

Modern LLM-based agents are possible thanks to specific advances in how we can use LLMs. A large language model alone is just a text generation machine – how do we get from next-token prediction to an agent that can, say, book a flight for you or debug your code? There are a few key techniques and developments that allow LLMs to function as agents:

### Function Calling and Tool Use

Perhaps the biggest enabler was giving LLMs the ability to output _structured actions_. Traditionally, you’d prompt an LLM with something like “Search the web for X” and hope it prints some pseudo-output like `SEARCH(X)`. Then your code would have to parse that text and execute a search. It was fragile – the model might not follow the format or might hallucinate tool names.

**Function Calling APIs** change that. In mid-2023, OpenAI introduced an API where developers can define functions (with schemas for arguments) and the model can decide to “call” a function by outputting a JSON object corresponding to that function ([Assistants Function Calling Beta - OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/function-calling#:~:text=Assistants%20Function%20Calling%20Beta%20,called%20along%20with%20their)). For example, you might register a function `search(query: string)` and if the model decides a web search is needed, it will return a JSON like `{"function": "search", "arguments": {"query": "price MacBook Pro"}}`. The developer code sees this and actually executes `search("price MacBook Pro")`, then passes the results back to the model. This closed the loop in a **robust, reliable way** – no need to do brittle prompt parsing of tool names. Other providers followed suit (Anthropic’s Claude can similarly suggest actions with a special syntax, and frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex adapted to use function calling when available ([Agents - OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/agents#:~:text=Tools%20enable%20agents%20to%20interact,common%20tasks%20like%20web))).

Function calling essentially lets the LLM output **actions instead of just text**, in a controllable format. It’s a game-changer for agents because now the LLM can safely say “I want to use Tool X with these parameters” and your code can catch that and do it. This drastically reduces the ambiguity and errors in tool use. It also allows **tool libraries** to be defined with rich schemas (using libraries like Pydantic, developers define exactly what args a tool expects, etc., making it even easier for the LLM to call correctly).

**Toolformer and In-Model Tool Use:** Even before official APIs, researchers were looking at training models to use tools. **Toolformer** (Meta AI, early 2023) showed that an LLM could be fine-tuned on a dataset where tool usage (API calls) are annotated in text, and the model learns to insert the correct API call when needed ([A Visual Guide to LLM Agents - by Maarten Grootendorst](https://newsletter.maartengrootendorst.com/p/a-visual-guide-to-llm-agents#:~:text=Schick%2C%20Timo%2C%20et%20al.%20,68551)). For instance, Toolformer could learn to call a calculator API when it sees a math problem, by generating a special `<calc>` token with the expression. This idea that _“language models can teach themselves to use tools”_ ([A Visual Guide to LLM Agents - by Maarten Grootendorst](https://newsletter.maartengrootendorst.com/p/a-visual-guide-to-llm-agents#:~:text=Schick%2C%20Timo%2C%20et%20al.%20,68551)) demonstrated that the _propensity_ to use tools can be baked into the model itself. OpenAI’s GPT-4 (2023) also has some of this baked-in capability (it will naturally follow the function calling protocol to call provided functions, without requiring examples each time).

The bottom line: With function calling and related approaches, LLMs can be treated as **cognitive engines that output actions**, not just words. This turns them into effective decision-makers within a larger loop.

### Code Execution as a Tool (Code Interpreter)

One special “tool” worth highlighting is the ability for an agent to **write and execute code**. Many tasks, especially for developers or data analysts, benefit from running code (for data cleaning, simulation, math, etc.). OpenAI’s _Code Interpreter_ (later known as Advanced Data Analysis) is essentially an agent that _writes Python code to solve user requests_, executes it in a sandbox, and uses the results in its answer. This concept is now used widely: an LLM agent can have a Python REPL as a tool, write itself some code (to, say, perform calculations or query a CSV file), run it, see the output, and decide next steps.

By letting the LLM _generate code as an intermediate step_, we give it a powerful problem-solving strategy: **program-aided reasoning**. Research from late 2022 introduced _Program-Aided Language Models (PAL)_, which have the LLM output a program to get the final answer ([PAL: Program-aided Language Models](https://reasonwithpal.com/#:~:text=We%20present%20Program,programs%20as%20the%20intermediate)). For example, instead of trying to solve a math word problem entirely in its head (which might lead to mistakes), the LLM writes a short Python script to compute the answer, runs it, and returns the result. PAL showed significantly improved accuracy on math and logic problems by this method ([What Are Program-Aided Language Models? - Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/articles/program-aided-language-models#:~:text=Program,than%20the%20LLMs%20reasoning%20alone)). Follow-up work in 2023 demonstrated that _program-aided reasoners not only get higher accuracy but also have better calibrated confidence_ (since they can verify things via code) ([Program-Aided Reasoners (better) Know What They Know - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09553#:~:text=Program,based%20counterparts)).

In practice, many agent frameworks now include a **code execution tool** (some call it a “sandbox” or “scratchpad”). The agent can offload heavy reasoning to code. For instance, if asked _“What’s the 10,000th prime number?”_, a good agent will just generate a Python script to compute primes rather than reasoning it out token by token. This is an example of how **LLMs enable agents to be more than LLMs** – the agent can do things (like precise math) that the raw model would struggle with, by using code.

Of course, executing code from an AI comes with **security risks**. Chip Huyen warns: an agent that can run code could be induced to run harmful code if not properly sandboxed ([Agents](https://huyenchip.com/2025/01/07/agents.html#:~:text=execute%20a%20piece%20of%20code%2C,the%20risk%20of%20code%20injection)). Real implementations run code in isolated environments and often restrict what it can do (e.g., disable networking or filesystem writes, etc.). Despite the risks, code execution capability makes agents immensely powerful as “general problem solvers” (since writing code is a general method to solve many tasks).

### Reasoning and Planning Techniques (ReAct, CoT, ToT, etc.)

On the algorithmic side, a variety of prompting techniques help LLMs with **planning their actions** and reasoning through problems. Some notable ones include:

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** Simply prompting the model to “think step by step” before answering. This was found to significantly improve complex reasoning by letting the model generate intermediate thoughts (which the user doesn’t see) that lead to a final answer ([What is tree-of-thoughts? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/tree-of-thoughts#:~:text=Difference%20between%20chain%20of%20thoughts,ToT)). Chain-of-thought alone isn’t an agent (it doesn’t interact with tools), but it laid the groundwork by showing that _we can prompt an LLM to output reasoning traces_.

- **ReAct (Reason + Act, 2022):** This technique explicitly interleaves _thoughts_ (the model’s thinking process) with _actions_ (commands to act). The ReAct prompting format has the model output a sequence like: “Thought: ... \n Action: ... \n Observation: ... \n Thought: ... \n Action: ...” and so on ([A Visual Guide to LLM Agents - by Maarten Grootendorst](https://newsletter.maartengrootendorst.com/p/a-visual-guide-to-llm-agents#:~:text=%2A%20Thought%20,step%20about%20the%20current%20situation)). After each Action, the environment (our code) provides the Observation (result), which the model uses to generate the next Thought. ReAct was one of the first prompt frameworks to enable an LLM to **dynamically decide what to do next** in a loop ([A Visual Guide to LLM Agents - by Maarten Grootendorst](https://newsletter.maartengrootendorst.com/p/a-visual-guide-to-llm-agents#:~:text=The%20LLM%20uses%20this%20prompt,of%20thoughts%2C%20actions%2C%20and%20observations)). For example, the model might think “I should search for X” (Thought), then output `Action: search["X"]`. The code executes the search and returns the result text as `Observation: "...result text..."`. The model reads that and continues. This turns a single-shot model into an agent that **iteratively reasons and acts** until it figures out the answer. ReAct is powerful because the model’s own thoughts guide the tool use. It essentially gives the LLM an internal scratchpad to reason about which tool to use and what to do next ([A Visual Guide to LLM Agents - by Maarten Grootendorst](https://newsletter.maartengrootendorst.com/p/a-visual-guide-to-llm-agents#:~:text=Image)). Many frameworks (like LangChain agents) adopted ReAct or variations of it under the hood.

- **Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT, 2023):** Tree-of-Thoughts extends the idea of chain-of-thought by allowing the model to explore **multiple possible solutions in a search tree** ([Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language ...](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601#:~:text=,the%20next%20course%20of)). Instead of a single linear chain of reasoning, the model can branch out: try different approaches, evaluate partial solutions, backtrack if needed. This is akin to how one might approach a puzzle by considering alternate paths. ToT prompting requires the model to generate possible next steps, then a heuristic to choose which branch to follow or expand ([What is tree-of-thoughts? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/tree-of-thoughts#:~:text=Tree%20of%20thoughts%20prompting%3A%20This,consistency%20mechanism%20is%20employed)) ([What is tree-of-thoughts? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/tree-of-thoughts#:~:text=a%20tree%20structure,prompting%20the%20model%20multiple%20times)). Essentially, the agent does a kind of _tree search_ in idea-space, using the LLM both to **generate options** and **evaluate them**. This deliberate planning and lookahead can improve performance on tasks that benefit from exploring different angles (like certain games or complex planning problems). IBM’s description calls ToT a _“ground-breaking framework”_ that _“allows for lookahead and exploration, where the model can explore multiple branches before committing to a path”_, injecting common-sense heuristics to evaluate each branch ([What is tree-of-thoughts? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/tree-of-thoughts#:~:text=Tree%20of%20thoughts%20prompting%3A%20This,consistency%20mechanism%20is%20employed)). In practice, ToT is more experimental, as it’s slower and more complex to implement than ReAct. But it points toward more _search-based planning_ for agents, rather than always greedily taking the first action that comes to mind.

- **Self-Reflection and Self-Correction:** After ReAct, researchers realized that adding a reflection phase can help catch mistakes. **Reflexion** (2023) is one approach where the agent, after completing a task (or upon failure), reflects on what went wrong and updates its knowledge or strategy for next time ([A Visual Guide to LLM Agents - by Maarten Grootendorst](https://newsletter.maartengrootendorst.com/p/a-visual-guide-to-llm-agents#:~:text=Nobody%2C%20not%20even%20LLMs%20with,can%20reflect%20on%20that%20process)) ([A Visual Guide to LLM Agents - by Maarten Grootendorst](https://newsletter.maartengrootendorst.com/p/a-visual-guide-to-llm-agents#:~:text=This%20process%20is%20missing%20from,11)). In a Reflexion loop, the LLM might take on two roles – an Actor (that does ReAct style thinking/acting) and an Evaluator or Reflector (that looks at the actions/outcomes and gives feedback) ([A Visual Guide to LLM Agents - by Maarten Grootendorst](https://newsletter.maartengrootendorst.com/p/a-visual-guide-to-llm-agents#:~:text=The%20method%20assumes%20three%20LLM,roles)). This feedback is stored in memory and used to improve subsequent decisions ([A Visual Guide to LLM Agents - by Maarten Grootendorst](https://newsletter.maartengrootendorst.com/p/a-visual-guide-to-llm-agents#:~:text=%2A%20Self,scores%20generated%20by%20the%20Evaluator)). Similarly, techniques like **Self-Refine** have the model iteratively refine its own output by generating critiques and improvements ([A Visual Guide to LLM Agents - by Maarten Grootendorst](https://newsletter.maartengrootendorst.com/p/a-visual-guide-to-llm-agents#:~:text=Memory%20modules%20are%20added%20to,mistakes%20and%20identify%20improved%20actions)). These methods blur the line between planning and learning – the agent is effectively trying to _learn from its mistakes_ on the fly. For example, if an agent failed to use the correct tool, a reflection step might note “I should have used the database tool instead of the API, because the API gave incomplete data.” That information can then alter the next trial.

All these techniques (ReAct, CoT, ToT, Reflexion, etc.) serve to **enhance the LLM’s problem-solving and decision-making** so that it can function effectively as the core of an agent. In practice, many frameworks combine ideas: e.g. use ReAct style prompting with an added final reflection at the end, or use chain-of-thought to produce a plan and then execute it. The field is in rapid flux – new methods are being published frequently (e.g., plan-and-solve loops, hierarchical planners, etc.). But as an agent developer, it’s useful to know these names and concepts, since frameworks or libraries might allow you to toggle them (for instance, some frameworks let you choose between a simple ReAct agent vs. a “reflective” agent, etc.).

### Memory: Short-Term, Long-Term, and Episodic

Memory is a critical component that enables agents to work on extended tasks. By default, an LLM has a fixed **context window** – maybe 4k, 16k, or even 100k tokens in newer models – but it’s not infinite. Agents get around this with various memory subsystems:

- **Short-Term Contextual Memory:** This is basically the prompt context the LLM sees in a single iteration. It might include the last N turns of Thought/Action/Observation, or a summary of them if the raw text is too long. The simplest approach is to keep a sliding window of recent interactions and feed that each time. This ensures the model has _some_ memory of what just happened (e.g., the result of the tool it just called). Many frameworks also prepend an _instruction or persona_ that persists (defining the agent’s overall goal or identity) each time.

- **Episodic Memory (Intermediate-term):** Episodic memory refers to storing important events or outcomes from earlier in the session and recalling them later as needed. For example, after each action/observation, an agent might store a summary: “I found that the user’s email is not verified yet.” Later, if the agent is about to do something related, it can recall that fact rather than searching again. Some frameworks have an explicit _Memory object_ that accumulates these facts. In **CrewAI**, for instance, they have a built-in memory module that automatically stores both short-term data and creates **embeddings** (vector representations) of key information for long-term recall ([Comparing OpenAI Swarm with other Multi Agent Frameworks - Arize AI](https://arize.com/blog/comparing-openai-swarm/#:~:text=Autogen%3A%20Offers%20a%20similar%20memory,key%20terms%20and%20memories%20automatically)). Episodic memory often involves heuristics for what to remember (not every observation is worth remembering).

- **Long-Term Memory (Vector Database):** For truly long-running agents or those that need outside knowledge, agents use a vector store (like FAISS, Weaviate, etc.) to implement long-term memory. Important content (documents, past conversations, results from research) can be embedded and stored. When needed, the agent can do a similarity search to _retrieve relevant items_ and insert them into the context. This is essentially how retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) works, applied to agent memory. Long-term memory might also be domain knowledge – e.g., an agent with a knowledge base of company policies that it can query when needed. The challenge is knowing _when_ to retrieve; some frameworks monitor the conversation and if a new question seems related to something earlier, they’ll fetch it. Others might always retrieve top-K similar to the current goal. There’s ongoing research on making this more dynamic.

- **State Persistence:** Some agent frameworks allow saving the entire state (including memory) to disk or a database, so an agent can be paused and resumed, or so that multiple instances share memory. This is important for production use where you might not want everything in RAM. For example, BeeAI supports persisting agent state (which includes memory) and even has **configurable memory strategies and state serialization** to manage this ([Bee AI - Framework AI Agent Builder](https://bestaiagents.ai/agent/beeai-framework#:~:text=BeeAI%20Framework%20is%20an%20open,for%20developing%20robust%20AI%20applications)) ([Bee AI - Framework AI Agent Builder](https://bestaiagents.ai/agent/beeai-framework#:~:text=seamless%20integration%20with%20models%20from,for%20developing%20robust%20AI%20applications)).

In summary, memory in an agent is a combination of using the LLM’s context wisely and extending it with external storage. A good memory system can dramatically improve an agent’s performance on complex tasks – it reduces redundancy (the agent can recall that it already tried X and it didn’t work) and increases coherence (it doesn’t contradict itself or forget the user’s original request). However, memory is also a source of complexity: too much information recalled can confuse the model (context pollution), and retrieving the right info at the right time is non-trivial. Agents often use summarization to compress old context (e.g., summarize older chat turns) and use vector search to fetch only what's relevant.

To ground this in an example: Microsoft’s Autogen framework provides a **“memory object”** for each agent that stores messages and facts between agents ([Comparing OpenAI Swarm with other Multi Agent Frameworks - Arize AI](https://arize.com/blog/comparing-openai-swarm/#:~:text=Swarm%3A%20Stores%20information%20across%20agent,key%20terms%20and%20memories%20automatically)). CrewAI goes further with an automated memory that creates vector embeddings of each important interaction, enabling semantic recall later ([Comparing OpenAI Swarm with other Multi Agent Frameworks - Arize AI](https://arize.com/blog/comparing-openai-swarm/#:~:text=Autogen%3A%20Offers%20a%20similar%20memory,key%20terms%20and%20memories%20automatically)). OpenAI’s Swarm, being stateless between calls, instead relies on passing along a _context variable_ to simulate memory across agent handoffs ([Comparing OpenAI Swarm with other Multi Agent Frameworks - Arize AI](https://arize.com/blog/comparing-openai-swarm/#:~:text=Memory%20Management)). Different designs, but all aim to give the agent some continuity over time.

## Classifying LLM Agents

Not all agents are built alike. It’s useful to have a mental framework for classifying different types of LLM agent systems. We can categorize LLM agents along several dimensions:

### By Framework Style

**Lightweight Orchestrators vs. Heavyweight Frameworks vs. Workflow Tools**

- **Lightweight Orchestrators:** These are minimal libraries or scripts that let you run an agent loop with little abstraction. They often just provide a convenient interface to an LLM with function-calling and maybe a basic memory. For example, OpenAI’s _Swarm_ (2023) is a relatively lightweight framework where an agent is basically an LLM plus instructions and tools, and you manually define how agents hand off control ([GitHub - openai/swarm: Educational framework exploring ergonomic, lightweight multi-agent orchestration. Managed by OpenAI Solution team.](https://github.com/openai/swarm#:~:text=Swarm%20focuses%20on%20making%20agent,highly%20controllable%2C%20and%20easily%20testable)). Lightweight orchestrators give you a lot of control – you’re basically writing Python code to manage the agent’s logic – and they have less “magic” under the hood. They are good for simple use cases or when you want to customize heavily. The downside is you don’t get lots of pre-built modules.

- **Heavyweight Agent Frameworks:** These provide a comprehensive structure for building agents, often including UI, debugging utilities, model integration, etc. They might support multi-agent conversations, come with a ton of tools pre-integrated, have database connectivity, and so on. **LangChain** is an example of a heavyweight (it’s a broad framework for any LLM application, not just agents, but it has an `agents` module). Heavy frameworks can save time by handling common tasks (tracing, memory management, error handling) but can be **complex and opinionated**. LangChain agents, for instance, automatically do things like parse the LLM output and call tools, but if something goes wrong, you have to dive into their abstractions. Heavy frameworks can also be _resource-heavy_ – loading unnecessary components if you only need a small subset ([Top 9 AI Agent Frameworks as of March 2025 | Shakudo](https://www.shakudo.io/blog/top-9-ai-agent-frameworks#:~:text=However%2C%20building%20and%20running%20applications,changes%20in%20the%20AI%20landscape)).

- **Workflow-Focused Tools:** Some systems are designed around **workflows or pipelines** rather than free-form agents. These can be thought of as “deterministic skeletons with LLM filling”. For example, **Rivet** and **Vellum** (mentioned by Anthropic ([Building Effective AI Agents \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20frameworks%20that,systems%20easier%20to%20implement%2C%20including))) are GUI builders where you chain blocks (LLM call, then a tool, then another LLM, etc.). Amazon’s Bedrock has an _“AI Agent”_ framework that leans towards well-defined flows (with the possibility of some LLM decisions in between) ([Building Effective AI Agents \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents#:~:text=There%20are%20many%20frameworks%20that,systems%20easier%20to%20implement%2C%20including)). These are useful in enterprise settings where you want predictability and maybe a visual diagram of what the agent will do. The trade-off is less flexibility – if the user asks something off the happy path, a workflow might not handle it unless you explicitly built that branch.

There’s a **continuum** here. Some frameworks like **BeeAI** try to straddle both: they allow _no-code workflow composition_ (they have a visual designer in development) but also support writing custom agent logic in Python/TypeScript for flexibility ([Comparing AI agent frameworks: CrewAI, LangGraph, and BeeAI](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/awb-comparing-ai-agent-frameworks-crewai-langgraph-and-beeai#:~:text=Comparing%20AI%20agent%20frameworks%3A%20CrewAI%2C,IBM%20for%20building%2C%20deploying)) ([Bee AI - Framework AI Agent Builder](https://bestaiagents.ai/agent/beeai-framework#:~:text=BeeAI%20Framework%20is%20an%20open,for%20developing%20robust%20AI%20applications)). When choosing a framework, it’s worth asking: do I need a quick orchestrator to prototype, or do I need a full-fledged system with UI, database, etc.? Your answer will guide you to a lightweight vs heavy solution.

### By Degree of Autonomy

**Tool-using vs. Task-Decomposing vs. Goal-Chasing Agents**

Not all agents have the same level of autonomy in how they handle tasks:

- **Tool-Using Agents:** At the basic level, an agent might just handle single user queries that require using one or more tools. For example, a _knowledge question answering agent_ that does a web search and then answers. It doesn’t break the user query into sub-tasks; it just knows to use tools to get to the answer. These agents operate on a _per-query basis_. Many “chat with your docs” assistants fall in this category: the user asks a question, the agent (LLM) decides which tool to call (maybe a vector DB for retrieval, then a calculator), and produces an answer. Once done, it doesn’t remember or pursue any further goal until the user asks the next question. Autonomy is limited to choosing tools for the current query.

- **Task-Decomposing Agents:** These go a step further by taking a high-level goal or complex query and splitting it into parts. For instance, if asked “Plan my 5-day trip to Japan and make sure to include some hiking”, a task-decomposing agent might break this into sub-tasks: “find popular destinations in Japan”, “find hiking spots”, “create itinerary day by day”, etc., then solve each. They often maintain a queue or list of sub-tasks. Notably, systems like the original BabyAGI implemented a loop of _generate tasks -> execute tasks -> review -> generate new tasks_. The agent kind of _manages a to-do list_. These agents exhibit more autonomy: the user’s input is just an initial objective, and the agent figures out the intermediate steps without user intervention. Many _research paper assistants_ or _project planning agents_ use this approach – they generate a plan (task list) and then work through it.

- **Goal-Chasing (Continuous) Agents:** This is the “fully autonomous until done (or stopped)” scenario. The user (or developer) gives an agent a broad goal, and the agent will keep performing actions, creating new objectives, reprioritizing, and iterating potentially indefinitely or until it deems the goal achieved. These agents often have a **feedback loop** to evaluate if the goal is reached or if new goals have emerged. A classic example would be _AutoGPT_, which when given a goal, would loop: plan -> execute -> get result -> adjust plan -> continue, sometimes even spawning new “helper” agents. Goal-chasing agents might also be multi-agent systems that internally debate or share tasks in pursuit of the overall goal. They require careful stopping criteria and safeguards (to not run forever or do something harmful). Autonomy is highest here – they operate with minimal oversight, and potentially over long durations. In practice, this is where a lot of hallucination and weird behavior happens if the agent isn’t well-structured, because the agent can drift off track without human feedback.

It’s worth noting that these are not strict categories but more like modes. The same framework could do all three, depending on how you configure it. For instance, you could use LangChain to make a one-shot tool-using agent or a multi-step goal-driven agent. The difference lies in how the agent decides when it’s “done” and how it handles objectives. **Tool-using agents** end when they’ve answered the question. **Task-decomposers** end when all sub-tasks are done and assembled. **Goal-chasers** might self-terminate when some success criteria is met (or simply after N iterations or a time limit).

When designing an agent, deciding its autonomy level is key. If you want predictable behavior, you might limit to tool-using or a fixed sequence of sub-tasks. If you want more automation, you allow dynamic task creation. But with greater autonomy comes greater risk of the agent going off the rails or needing more complex prompting to stay focused.

### By Architecture and Interaction Pattern

**Planner-Executor, Multi-Agent (Swarm), State Machine, Workflow DAG**

Agents can also be classified by the **architectural pattern** used internally:

- **Planner-Executor Pattern:** This is a common design where one component (the _planner_) formulates a plan or sequence of steps, and another component (the _executor_) carries out those steps, possibly with an LLM as well. For example, the planner might be an LLM prompt that produces something like “Step 1: Do X, Step 2: Do Y, Step 3: Do Z”, and then another part (or even the same LLM in a different mode) executes each step and maybe verifies the outcome. This separation can simplify problem-solving – the planning step sees the big picture, while the executor focuses on one step at a time. Some frameworks allow explicitly using a large model for planning and smaller ones for execution for efficiency. The downside is that plans can be brittle if something unexpected happens (the executor might face a situation the planner didn’t anticipate). But patterns like this can be found in systems like the classic “MAIA” agent, or you can manually implement it by prompting GPT-4 for a plan, then using GPT-3.5 to do each sub-task, for instance.

- **Swarm-Based (Multi-Agent Collaboration):** Instead of a single agent handling everything, you have a **team of agents** with different roles that collaborate. For example, you might have a “Brainstormer” agent and a “Critic” agent that talk to each other, or an “Engineer” and “PM” agent that have a conversation to solve a problem (the _CAMEL_ framework popularized a method of two agents role-playing as user and assistant to solve a task ([A Visual Guide to LLM Agents - by Maarten Grootendorst](https://newsletter.maartengrootendorst.com/p/a-visual-guide-to-llm-agents#:~:text=With%20CAMEL%2C%20for%20instance%2C%20the,and%20will%20guide%20the%20process)) ([A Visual Guide to LLM Agents - by Maarten Grootendorst](https://newsletter.maartengrootendorst.com/p/a-visual-guide-to-llm-agents#:~:text=This%20role,communication%20between%20agents))). OpenAI’s **Swarm** framework explicitly models multiple agents and how they hand off control via function calls ([Comparing OpenAI Swarm with other Multi Agent Frameworks - Arize AI](https://arize.com/blog/comparing-openai-swarm/#:~:text=3,transfer%20control%20to%20another%20agent)) ([Comparing OpenAI Swarm with other Multi Agent Frameworks - Arize AI](https://arize.com/blog/comparing-openai-swarm/#:~:text=CrewAI%3A%20Supports%20a%20variety%20of,agent%20interactions%20through%20function%20calling)). Microsoft’s **Autogen** allows spawning multiple agents like a hierarchy – e.g., a “manager” agent and several “worker” agents that can converse ([Comparing OpenAI Swarm with other Multi Agent Frameworks - Arize AI](https://arize.com/blog/comparing-openai-swarm/#:~:text=Agent%20collaboration%20is%20a%20core,organizing%20how%20agents%20work%20together)). Multi-agent architectures can mimic human teams or multiple experts collaborating (one agent might be good at coding, another at writing docs, etc.). They can also implement an internal **debate or reflection** (one agent generates an idea, another evaluates it). The challenge here is managing the communication so it doesn’t devolve into infinite loops or trivial chats. But when done right, multi-agent approaches can break complex tasks into parts handled in parallel or bring diverse perspectives to improve results.

- **State Machines & Directed Workflows:** Some agents are built as a state machine – i.e., a fixed set of states and transitions. For example, an agent could have states: `GREET`, `ASK_QUESTION`, `FETCH_DATA`, `RESPOND`. The LLM could still be used within each state (to produce the actual text or decide minor choices), but the overall flow is hardcoded. This is common in customer support bots: they might have a structured dialogue flow with slots to fill. It’s arguable if those are “LLM agents” or just traditional bots with LLM inside, but the line is blurry. **State machines** give you predictability (you know all possible flows), at the cost of flexibility. There are frameworks like IBM’s Watson Assistant, etc., that are essentially state machine planners with ML for intent recognition – not quite LLM agents, but one could integrate an LLM to decide transitions too. A more LLM-centric example is using the **Guidance** library, where you can script a conversation flow with the LLM filling in parts.

- **Dynamic Workflow Graphs:** Another pattern is representing the agent’s task as a **graph of nodes** (which could be sub-tasks or skills) and edges (dependencies or sequence). The agent’s job is then to traverse or build this graph to complete the task. **LangGraph** (by LangChain) is explicitly an orchestration framework for agentic workflows that can be represented as graphs/cycles rather than linear chains ([LangGraph - LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph#:~:text=LangGraph%20is%20an%20orchestration%20framework,LangChain%20provides%20a%20standard)). For instance, you could design a graph where node1 = get user requirements, node2 = do searches in parallel on different topics, node3 = combine results, node4 = draft answer, node5 = critique answer, node6 = final answer. The LLM (or multiple LLM calls) move through this graph. The graph can even have loops (cycles) to indicate iteration until a condition is met. This approach merges the idea of a “workflow” with flexibility: the structure is defined, but within it the LLM has freedom on content. It’s good when you know roughly the stages needed, but want the agent to handle the details.

Many real systems mix these architectures. For example, you might have a swarm of agents, each of which internally uses ReAct in a loop (so each agent itself is an LLM loop, and you have multiple of them interacting). Or you might have a planner-executor pair where the executor itself is a multi-agent system. Thinking in terms of these patterns is useful when you evaluate frameworks: some frameworks naturally support multi-agent (Camel, AutoGen, BeeAI), others are built around single-agent loops. Some allow easy custom workflow graphs (LangChain+LangGraph), others assume a mostly linear ReAct loop.

### By Application Domain

Finally, we can classify agents by what **domain or purpose** they are built for, as this often dictates design choices:

- **Research Assistants:** Agents that help with research – e.g., literature review agents that find and summarize academic papers, or market research agents that gather info from the web. These usually emphasize _tool use (search, APIs)_ and _summarization_. Memory of what’s found is important. They might also do task decomposition (“find papers on X, then extract key points, then compare findings…”). An example is an agent that given a topic, autonomously searches for articles and builds a report. These often run in a loop until the user stops or a thorough report is compiled.

- **Customer Support or Personal Assistants:** Agents that handle conversations with users to solve support questions or help with tasks like scheduling. These often need a mixture of some structure (to ensure helpfulness, adherence to policy) and flexibility (handling open-ended queries). Tool use might include looking up account info, knowledge base search, etc. Autonomy is medium – they might handle multi-turn without human, but often these are designed to eventually hand off to a human if out of scope. Key challenges here are maintaining context over a potentially long dialog, and not hallucinating false info (especially if connected to company data).

- **RPA (Robotic Process Automation):** These agents perform actions on a computer or through APIs to automate workflows (like taking info from an email and entering it into a CRM, etc.). Essentially, they act like a human clicking around apps or calling backend APIs. For LLM agents in RPA, connecting to system APIs or controlling a browser/desktop is key. An example is **Adept’s ACT-1** (not open source) which can control a web browser via an interface. Open source attempts like _Ghostwriter_ or _AutoGPT with browser automation_ fall here. These require strong tool integration and often a planner to decide what sequence of operations to do (e.g., open site, log in, find data, copy to somewhere). Security and reliability are huge concerns (you don’t want the agent deleting the wrong thing).

- **Code Assistants:** Agents for software engineering tasks – writing code, fixing bugs, generating tests, etc. These combine coding capability with tool use (like running code, reading documentation, using a debugger). They may break tasks: e.g., “implement feature X” might be broken into “edit file A”, “edit file B”, “run tests”. They often use the code execution tool heavily. Ensuring the agent doesn’t produce wrong or dangerous code is a challenge. Examples include the _GPT-Engineer_ style agents or the new GitHub Copilot experiments that can handle multi-step tasks.

- **Creative Assistants:** Agents that can generate stories, design documents, marketing copy, or even do things like generate images via API. These might chain tools like image generators or retrieval of inspirational content. They may not need heavy planning; rather, the focus is on iterating with feedback (maybe the agent critiques its outputs or tries variations). For instance, an agent that generates a draft ad copy, then checks sentiment (via a tool or LLM), then revises if it’s off-target.

Each domain places different emphasis on the core components. For instance, a research agent might need a **large memory** and heavy web tooling, whereas a customer support agent needs a **strict knowledge base retrieval** to avoid saying unsupported things. RPA might need a very deterministic plan following to not mess up actions, whereas a creative assistant can be more free-form.

When someone says “LLM agent”, it could mean all sorts of systems – so understanding the context (what is it trying to do, and how) is crucial. It’s often helpful to clarify: “an agent for _what_?”. In developing an agent, focusing on the specific domain/task will guide the choices for all the above aspects (autonomy, architecture, memory, etc.).

## Comparing Open Source Agent Frameworks

Dozens of open-source frameworks have emerged to simplify building LLM agents. Each comes with different philosophies and features. Let’s compare some of the notable ones (as of March 2025) and then discuss when you might choose one over another. The frameworks we’ll look at are:

- **AutoGen (Microsoft)**
- **CrewAI**
- **Agno**
- **Swarm (OpenAI)**
- **smol**🐢**Agents (Hugging Face)**
- **Camel / OWL (CAMEL-AI)**
- **LangChain + LangGraph**
- **Pydantic AI**
- **Upsonic**
- **Atomic Agents**
- **AG2**
- **BeeAI (IBM)**

### Choosing the Right Framework

It’s not one-size-fits-all. Here’s a _“You should choose X if…”_ summary for quick guidance:

- **Choose AutoGen (Microsoft)** if you want a **robust multi-agent convo** system out-of-the-box, especially if using OpenAI/Azure OpenAI. It’s great for scenarios where agents talk to each other (e.g. an AI assistant and a code assistant solving together) and you want a well-tested library. It’s backed by MSR, so it’s relatively reliable for research and prototyping. Less suitable if you want minimal overhead or not using MS/OpenAI APIs.

- **Choose CrewAI** if you need a **LangChain alternative that’s lightweight**. It’s pure Python, fast, and you can integrate any LLM easily. Good for production where you want control over every part (no hidden chain-of-thought parsing magic) but still want conveniences (memory management, tasks). CrewAI’s task system is nice for clarity – each agent knows its specific jo ([Comparing OpenAI Swarm with other Multi Agent Frameworks - Arize AI](https://arize.com/blog/comparing-openai-swarm/#:~:text=communication%20modes%20between%20agents))】. If you found LangChain agents too slow or opaque, CrewAI is a solid bet.

- **Choose Agno** if you’re working with **multimodal agents** or want a very **pluggable architecture**. For example, an agent that processes images or audio along with text – Agno is built for that. Also if you value a framework that claims to be “any model, any provider, any modality” – meaning you can swap between GPT-4 and local LLaMA, etc. It’s newer, so might need more hands-on tweaking.

- **Choose OpenAI’s Swarm/Agents SDK** if you want to **learn multi-agent patterns** in the simplest way or build a quick prototype that specifically does agent handoffs. If your use case is straightforward and you’re using OpenAI API anyway, the new Agents SDK (which succeeds Swarm) might be convenient. However, for production you might outgrow it quickly – it’s more of a teaching tool turned minimal framewor ([GitHub - openai/swarm: Educational framework exploring ergonomic, lightweight multi-agent orchestration. Managed by OpenAI Solution team.](https://github.com/openai/swarm#:~:text=Important))】.

- **Choose Hugging Face smolAgents** if you are a **beginner to agents or want transparency**. It’s literally showing you the code the agent writes to solve your query – very cool for understanding and debugging. Also, since it’s Hugging Face, it plays well with open-source models (you can run it with local models via `HfApiModel` or even use their Hub). It’s not geared for multi-agent or super complex flows, but for single-agent “here’s a problem, figure it out by writing code or calling a tool”, it’s excellent. Also lightweight enough to embed in apps without too many deps.

- **Choose CAMEL/OWL** if you are exploring the **cutting edge of multi-agent AI** and perhaps pushing research boundaries. CAMEL is great for research simulations (like simulating a virtual society of agents, as in the Generative Agents paper ([A Visual Guide to LLM Agents - by Maarten Grootendorst](https://newsletter.maartengrootendorst.com/p/a-visual-guide-to-llm-agents#:~:text=Interactive%20Simulacra%20of%20Human%20Behavior)) ([A Visual Guide to LLM Agents - by Maarten Grootendorst](https://newsletter.maartengrootendorst.com/p/a-visual-guide-to-llm-agents#:~:text=The%20profile%20each%20Generative%20Agent,more%20interesting%20and%20dynamic%20behavior))】. OWL is more practical and if you need the absolute state-of-art multi-agent system with the latest strategies (and you don’t mind it evolving fast), it could be very powerful. It’s possibly overkill for simple agent needs. Also, these frameworks might expect you to have access to powerful models (since multi-agent can multiply token usage).

- **Choose LangChain (+ LangGraph)** if you want a **batteries-included solution with wide support**. If your use-case involves many different tools, data connections, etc., LangChain probably has an integration for it. It’s also good if you plan to use LangSmith (their observability) or need to quickly stand up an agent in a notebook with minimal coding. But be prepared to spend time understanding its abstractions; and for production, you might have to slim it down or remove unnecessary parts to improve performance. Use LangGraph if you specifically need more control over agent steps than the default agents give.

- **Choose Pydantic AI** if you care about **structured, validated interactions and reliability**. This is ideal for _production systems where output format matters_, e.g., an agent filling out a database record – you can define a Pydantic model for that record and the agent will produce exactly that. Also good if you want to utilize type hints and have a more maintainable code-base for your agent logic. If you’re already a fan of Pydantic, this will feel natural. It might not have as many built-in fancy planning features as others (it’s relatively straightforward in approach), but that simplicity can mean fewer surprises.

- **Choose Upsonic** if you are in an **enterprise setting that needs robust task automation** with support and you care about governance. For instance, if you want to deploy an agent to automate parts of your business process and have a UI for your ops team to monitor it, Upsonic is targeting that niche. They highlight cost-efficiency, meaning it may have features to optimize API calls or cache results. Since it’s new, evaluate if it meets your needs, but it looks promising for serious deployments.

- **Choose Atomic Agents** if you want a **modular, transparent approach** and possibly to integrate with the **Instructor** ecosystem. It’s great for developers who want to assemble their agent step-by-step and ensure each part is testable (like unit testing each atomic component). Also if you want to easily swap LLM providers (Instructor gives that flexibility), Atomic could be a fit. It’s relatively young, but its philosophy of “small building blocks” is attractive for customizing. If you found big frameworks too convoluted, Atomic Agents might be refreshing.

- **Choose AG2** if (as more info emerges) you are interested in the **next-gen AutoGPT-ish** frameworks. Perhaps it focuses on **self-improvement loops** or other advanced features. If you like being on the bleeding edge and contributing to open source agents, you might play with AG2. For mission-critical stuff, you’d likely wait until it proves itself.

- **Choose BeeAI (IBM)** if you need a **scalable, enterprise-grade multi-agent platform** with multi-language support (Python/TypeScript) and you trust IBM’s backing. It’s a good choice if you want to integrate agents into a larger microservice architecture (since it has a server component and TS client, etc.). For example, if building an app where some parts run in browser (TS) and some on server (Python), BeeAI could let them share agent logic. It’s also aligned with standards like the Model Context Protocol (MCP ([5 AI agent frameworks that support MCP servers. - Threads](https://www.threads.net/@unwind_ai/post/DHq5QDuOeQI/5-beeai-framework-is-an-open-source-framework-for-building-deploying-and-serving#:~:text=5%20AI%20agent%20frameworks%20that,The%20framework%20includes))】 which is geared towards multi-agent interop. BeeAI is suited for complex projects where you might even compose agents from different frameworks (they mention running agents from any framework ([Impressive evolution of BeeAI - DEV Community](https://dev.to/aairom/impressive-evolution-of-beeai-2faj#:~:text=Impressive%20evolution%20of%20BeeAI%20,from%20any%20framework%20and%20language))】. If you just need a simple agent, BeeAI might be too heavy; but for a complex workflow hub, it shines.

### Framework Commentary

Let’s provide a bit more narrative on each framework’s strengths, weaknesses, and use cases (some of which were already touched on):

- **AutoGen:** Strengths – very flexible (multi-agent or single-agent, can integrate humans in loop too), has nice abstractions for different agent types (they have roles like UserProxy, Assistant, etc.). Also asynchronous, which means you can scale agents that wait for I/O without blocking thread ([AutoGen - Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/autogen/#:~:text=Over%20the%20past%20year%2C%20our,by%20learning%20and%20valuable%20feedback)) ([AutoGen - Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/autogen/#:~:text=patterns%2C%20and%20for%20reusable%20components,observability%2C%20more%20flexible%20collaboration%20patterns))】. Weaknesses – a bit complex to grasp initially, and it’s Python only. Use cases – multi-agent chat scenarios (e.g., an agent that splits into a questioner and solver that converse), or complex workflows where an agent might delegate subtasks to other agents. Community is growing due to MS backing, but it’s still more a research framework (no web UI or something fancy).

- **CrewAI:** Strengths – speed, simplicity, independence from LangChain (no heavy deps). It explicitly focuses on _not_ being over-engineered. Also its memory system that auto-embeds important info is very hand ([Comparing OpenAI Swarm with other Multi Agent Frameworks - Arize AI](https://arize.com/blog/comparing-openai-swarm/#:~:text=Autogen%3A%20Offers%20a%20similar%20memory,key%20terms%20and%20memories%20automatically))】. Weaknesses – smaller community, so fewer plug-and-play integrations (but you can use LangChain tools if needed). Use cases – when you want to build an agent in a script or backend service and need it efficient. For example, an agent to monitor logs and create reports continuously – CrewAI could handle that in a resource-light way.

- **Agno:** Strengths – multimodal and truly model-agnostic. If you want an agent that can say, take an image input and ask an LLM about it and then return an answer with an image, Agno’s design for multi-modality is grea ([Agno Framework: A Lightweight Library for Building Multimodal Agents](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2025/03/agno-framework/#:~:text=Agno%20Framework%3A%20A%20Lightweight%20Library,images%2C%20audio%2C%20and%20video)) ([Best 5 Frameworks To Build Multi-Agent AI Applications - GetStream.io](https://getstream.io/blog/multiagent-ai-frameworks/#:~:text=Best%205%20Frameworks%20To%20Build,and%20open%20LLMs%20from))】. Also it’s lightweight and claims high performance. Weaknesses – documentation and community might not be as extensive, and multimodal can be complex to implement in practice (needing model support for each modality). Use cases – advanced assistants that do more than text: e.g., a voice assistant that uses speech recognition (as input tool) and text generation, or a robot with vision where the agent processes camera images via an image captioning tool.

- **Swarm (OpenAI):** Strengths – extremely simple to set up, good for conceptual understanding or quick prototypes. The idea of using function calls for agent handoff is elegan ([Comparing OpenAI Swarm with other Multi Agent Frameworks - Arize AI](https://arize.com/blog/comparing-openai-swarm/#:~:text=1,transfer%20control%20to%20another%20agent))】. Weaknesses – stateless by design (no built-in memory), no bells and whistles; also officially replaced by a more supported SDK no ([GitHub - openai/swarm: Educational framework exploring ergonomic, lightweight multi-agent orchestration. Managed by OpenAI Solution team.](https://github.com/openai/swarm#:~:text=Important))】. Use cases – maybe orchestrating a few specialized agents for a simple task. For instance, one agent handles user dialogue, and hands off to a math specialist agent when needed (via a function call) – Swarm can implement that easil ([Comparing OpenAI Swarm with other Multi Agent Frameworks - Arize AI](https://arize.com/blog/comparing-openai-swarm/#:~:text=1,transfer%20control%20to%20another%20agent))】. But if you need persistence or complex multi-step, you’d layer that on or use something else.

- **smolAgents:** Strengths – simplicity, debuggability (the code-as-action approach means you can examine exactly what the agent tried to do by reading the code it wrote). Also being from HuggingFace, it natively supports local models which is great for privacy or cost. Weaknesses – might be too simplistic for some tasks; each action is basically a code execution, so if the agent needs to use multiple tools or handle non-code actions, it might be awkward. Use cases – data analysis agent, small coding tasks, educational use to see how LLM can solve a problem step by step. Possibly good for hackathons or teaching LLM prompting, since you can watch it think through code.

- **Camel / OWL:** Strengths – state-of-the-art multi-agent strategies, community research momentum. OWL in particular is topping benchmarks (the GAIA multi-agent benchmark) with its result ([GitHub - camel-ai/owl: OWL: Optimized Workforce Learning for General Multi-Agent Assistance in Real-World Task Automation](https://github.com/camel-ai/owl#:~:text=OWL%20achieves%2058,source%20frameworks))】. They also have a web interface and appear to be building a whole ecosystem (MCP for agent comms ([GitHub - camel-ai/owl: OWL: Optimized Workforce Learning for General Multi-Agent Assistance in Real-World Task Automation](https://github.com/camel-ai/owl#:~:text=,Contributing))】. Weaknesses – complexity and computational cost. Multi-agent is expensive as each agent is an LLM call, so running a team of 5 agents with GPT-4 can be 5x the cost of one. Also more moving parts to debug. Use cases – simulation of scenarios (game AI, virtual world NPCs interacting), or very hard problems where you want multiple perspectives (maybe an agent for complex legal research where one agent plays the role of pro argument, another con argument, etc., to explore all sides).

- **LangChain+LangGraph:** Strengths – huge community, lots of examples and tutorials. If you need something odd (like an agent that parses PubMed papers and then plots a graph), chances are someone has a LangChain example or tool for it. LangGraph adds the ability to design loops and branches explicitl ([LangGraph Tutorial: Building LLM Agents with LangChain's ... - Zep](https://www.getzep.com/ai-agents/langgraph-tutorial#:~:text=LangGraph%20Tutorial%3A%20Building%20LLM%20Agents,Unlike%20traditional))】, which is great when ReAct’s implicit loop isn’t enough. Weaknesses – performance overhead, and historically LangChain’s agent framework was sometimes flaky (prompt formatting issues, etc., though it’s improved). Also not specialized: it tries to do everything, which can be overwhelming to navigate. Use cases – quick prototyping when you need to integrate multiple data sources, or if you want to instrument the agent (LangChain’s callbacks let you log each step easily). Also if you need to chain non-agent LLM calls with agent calls (LangChain can glue those together).

- **Pydantic AI:** Strengths – type safety and clarity. It’s refreshing to define what you expect and have the agent output exactly that or error. Good logging and introspection (fits well with Python async and pydantic’s own logging). Weaknesses – still new, so fewer high-level examples of complex agents. Might require you to design more of the logic since it’s not as opinionated. Use cases – APIs or systems where the agent’s output feeds directly into other programs. For example, an agent that returns a structured result that your app uses – Pydantic AI ensures you don’t have to write brittle parsing of the LLM output. Also good when you have multiple agents delegating work (they mention “agent delegation” where one agent calls another – having schemas for each makes that easier to manage ([Multi-agent Applications - PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/multi-agent-applications/#:~:text=Multi,agent%20delegates%20work%20to))】.

- **Upsonic:** Strengths – focus on reliability. It mentions things like priority-based execution, error recovery, audit trail ([Top 9 AI Agent Frameworks as of March 2025 | Shakudo](https://www.shakudo.io/blog/top-9-ai-agent-frameworks#:~:text=Task%20Orchestration%20Framework%3A%20Automated%20workflow,and%20recovery%20mechanisms%20for%20emergencies))】. These are important for real deployments. Also a client-server architecture indicates you can run the agent as a service and connect to it, which is good for scaling in an org. Weaknesses – relatively unknown in open community; might be slightly closed in terms of how much you can customize (not sure, need to evaluate). Use cases – think of replacing a human in a repetitive computer process at a company: Upsonic aims to be the framework to build that agent, monitor it, and integrate it safely. If I were constructing a complex “digital worker” for, say, processing insurance claims (reading docs, inputting in system, sending emails), I would evaluate Upsonic.

- **Atomic Agents:** Strengths – very clear structure (each part of the agent pipeline is an _atomic_ component). Encourages good practice by enforcing schema on inputs/outputs, and being explicit about memory and tools. Also since it’s built on Instructor, you automatically get multi-provider support. Weaknesses – might require more assembly (less plug-and-play than LangChain). The community is smaller, so you’ll rely on their docs or a few examples. Use cases – custom multi-step workflows, especially if you want to integrate into an existing Python codebase. For example, if you have an app and you want to add an AI workflow at some point, you could incorporate Atomic Agents to design that workflow in code with full control.

- **AG2:** (Speculative commentary) If it is indeed an evolution of AutoGPT ideas: Strengths would be improved autonomy and possibly memory handling vs the original. Could incorporate Reflexion or other new techniques to avoid getting stuck. Weaknesses – unknown stability. Use cases – long-running autonomous tasks where you basically just give a goal and minimal guidance. Since others have also implemented similar loops, AG2 would have to differentiate (maybe better UI or easier setup).

- **BeeAI:** Strengths – built by IBM Research, so likely well-architected for scale. Multi-language support is a plus if you want front-end integration. It specifically lists features like **token optimization** and \*_error handling_ ([Bee AI - Framework AI Agent Builder](https://bestaiagents.ai/agent/beeai-framework#:~:text=seamless%20integration%20with%20models%20from,for%20developing%20robust%20AI%20applications))】, which shows attention to practical concerns (some frameworks assume infinite retries or perfect outputs, which isn’t real world). It also aims to be a unifier (“compose AI agents from any framework” ([Impressive evolution of BeeAI - DEV Community](https://dev.to/aairom/impressive-evolution-of-beeai-2faj#:~:text=Impressive%20evolution%20of%20BeeAI%20,from%20any%20framework%20and%20language))】 – interesting if you want to leverage, say, a LangChain agent within BeeAI or vice versa. Weaknesses – IBM’s ecosystem might not be familiar to everyone, and historically some IBM open projects haven’t gained as much traction despite quality (could be overshadowed by more hyped projects). Use cases – enterprise AI orchestration. E.g., a bank building an AI assistant that connects to internal tools and has to ensure data doesn’t leak – BeeAI’s structure might allow enforcing policies at a framework level.

In conclusion, the “best” framework depends on your priorities: quick development vs fine control, experimental vs production, single-agent vs multi-agent, etc. The good news is all these frameworks are open source (or at least free), so you can experiment and even mix components (some people use LangChain for tool definitions but run a custom loop, etc.). The field is maturing, and we may even see consolidation or standard protocols (like Anthropic’s MCP aims to standardize how agents communicate context).

## Challenges & Gaps in LLM Agents

Even with powerful models and fancy frameworks, LLM agents face significant **challenges**. It’s important to be aware of these when building and deploying agents:

- **Hallucinations and Accuracy:** LLMs can _make stuff up_. When an agent is autonomously working, a hallucination can cascade – e.g., the agent believes a false piece of info and plans actions around it. Agents might hallucinate the existence of a tool (“I will use the budget-approval tool” – which doesn’t exist) or the outcome of an action that wasn’t actually taken. Mitigation strategies include using **verification steps** (have the agent double-check important facts via a tool), restricting the knowledge domain (so it can’t stray too far), or applying _critics_ that spot inconsistencies. But hallucination remains a core issue; it’s inherited from the LLM and not fully solved. Every tool use is an opportunity to correct or confirm (e.g., if it says “According to the database, X is true”, ensure that came from an actual database query). Rigorous evaluation on known tasks can help identify how often your agent hallucinates.

- **Brittleness and Error Handling:** Agents can be **brittle**, meaning a slight change in input or context can break the chain of thought. For example, if a tool returns an unexpected format, the agent might get confused and output garbage. Many current agents are essentially giant prompt chains, and prompts are fragile. Also, multi-step reasoning can go wrong in many ways: the agent might loop forever, or get stuck in a subtask and never return to the main task, or use tools in the wrong order. Error handling (like try/except around tool calls, or a timeout if it loops too much) is crucial to add. CrewAI’s developer noted that adding a Task object helped give structure and avoid some brittleness by clarifying what each agent can d ([Comparing OpenAI Swarm with other Multi Agent Frameworks - Arize AI](https://arize.com/blog/comparing-openai-swarm/#:~:text=assistants%20that%20interact%20in%20structured,versatile%20communication%20modes%20between%20agents))】. But in general, making agents reliably do the right thing every time is hard – they often behave unpredictably in edge cases. Writing tests for your agent logic (like simulated scenarios) can expose brittleness early.

- **Evaluation Difficulty:** How do you **evaluate** an agent’s performance? Unlike single-turn QA (where you can simply check the answer), an agent might do a whole sequence of things. You need to assess not only _final outcome_ but also _process_: Did it choose reasonable steps? Did it recover from errors? Traditional metrics don’t capture this well. One approach is to break evaluation into parts: evaluate the success on the overall task (e.g. did it book the flight successfully?), and also evaluate intermediate decisions (maybe via human feedback or comparison to an expert trajectory). Chip Huyen suggests identifying failure modes and measuring how often they occu ([Agents](https://huyenchip.com/2025/01/07/agents.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L943%20Evaluation%20is,Some%20of)) ([Agents](https://huyenchip.com/2025/01/07/agents.html#:~:text=To%20evaluate%20an%20agent%2C%20identify,of%20these%20failure%20modes%20happens))】 – for example, define “planning failure = agent chose a tool that was irrelevant” and see in 100 runs how many times that happens. Some frameworks include tracing tools that let you log each step and outcome for analysis. Another angle is **benchmarking**: frameworks like OWL mention GAIA benchmark which probably has standardized tasks to score agent ([GitHub - camel-ai/owl: OWL: Optimized Workforce Learning for General Multi-Agent Assistance in Real-World Task Automation](https://github.com/camel-ai/owl#:~:text=OWL%20achieves%2058,source%20frameworks))】. Expect to put in effort to evaluate your specific agent, possibly writing custom scripts or using services like **Arize** to trace and evaluate agent conversations.

- **Memory Limitations:** While we add memory modules to agents, they’re still constrained by the underlying LLM’s context window and the quality of retrieval. Agents can **forget** important details or, conversely, overload themselves with too much irrelevant recalled info. Vector search can bring wrong context if the query isn’t well-formed (garbage in, garbage out). There’s also the issue of **knowledge cutoff** – an agent might not have up-to-date info (unless it can tool out to the internet). Memory can also become expensive: if your agent tries to stuff the last 50 interactions into every prompt, token usage skyrockets. A challenge is deciding what to keep in short-term memory vs summarize vs offload to long-term. And if an agent operates for a very long time (say, runs 24/7), how do you manage an ever-growing memory store? Some experimental agents have had “growing prompt” problems where they keep appending to their context until it’s too large. Techniques like periodic summarization, using forgetting mechanisms (e.g., drop or compress low-relevance memories) are being tried. But an agent’s memory will always be a lossy compression of the past.

- **Security and Safety:** Agents that can take actions (especially code execution, file system access, or external API calls) pose security risks. A malicious or prompt-injected instruction could cause an agent to do harm: e.g., “delete all records” if it has database access. Even read-only actions can leak sensitive data (imagine an agent that helpfully summarizes a private document – if prompt injection occurs, it might reveal that summary to an attacker). Sandboxing and principle of least privilege are musts: e.g., run code in an isolated environment, give agents API keys that have limited permissions. For web browsing tools, consider filtering URLs. Another safety aspect is the content the agent might generate: if an agent is conversational, it might produce inappropriate or biased responses without proper alignment. Combining the open-ended nature of LLMs with action-taking is double tricky – you have to worry about both **toxic output** and **toxic actions**. Some frameworks have a “Safeguard” agent (AutoGen mentions roles like a safety guard ([AutoGen - Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/autogen/#:~:text=Image%3A%20AutoGen%20header%20graphic%20showing,User%2C%20Commander%2C%20Writer%2C%20and%20Safeguard))】 that monitors interactions. But this area is evolving – it’s recommended to put manual review steps for high-stakes outcomes until you trust the agent fully.

- **Performance and Cost:** LLM agents can be expensive and slow. If each thought-action-observation cycle calls an API, a complex task might result in dozens of API calls. This can be both latency-intensive and cost-incurring (for paid models). There’s a challenge in optimizing agents to do as few steps as possible, or to use cheaper models when appropriate. Some solutions: use a fast model for brainstorming and a slow model for final answers; set a cap on steps; or use caching (if an agent asks the same question to a tool repeatedly, cache the answer). Cost profiling your agent helps – see which steps are most expensive and see if they can be reduced. Upsonic’s focus on cost-effective orchestration hints at tooling for thi ([Upsonic: Introduction](https://docs.upsonic.ai/introduction#:~:text=Upsonic%3A%20Introduction%20Upsonic%20offers%20a,effectively))】. Also, if running locally, performance can be a bottleneck (running a 13B model 100 times in a loop might be too slow). Techniques like compressing multiple instructions into one (having the LLM do more per step) can trade some reliability for speed.

- **Lack of Long-Horizon Planning:** Current agents are still fairly myopic. They don’t truly plan far into the future. While they can decompose tasks, they don’t have a notion of _learning and improving over weeks_ or maintaining a consistent strategy over thousands of steps. Each run is largely independent (unless you implement some persistent learning). This means agents might make short-sighted decisions. For example, a goal-chasing agent might waste resources early on and then not have enough context window left for later. Some research is looking into agents that can _learn from experience_ (e.g., fine-tune the model based on success/fail outcomes, or maintain a knowledge base of “what works”). But in most frameworks, an agent doesn’t really improve unless a human adjusts it. There’s a gap in building agents that have _meta-cognition_ – awareness of their own performance and the ability to self-correct beyond just immediate Reflexion (like, after failing a task, updating parameters or policy so they do better next time).

Many of these gaps are active research areas. For a developer implementing an agent now, the best practice is to **assume the agent will make mistakes** and design around that: give it chances to correct (e.g., ask itself “did that make sense?”), log everything for analysis, and have fallbacks (maybe if agent is unsure or fails, ask user for clarification or revert to a safe mode).

**Evaluation** deserves an extra note: evaluating agents often requires _scenario testing_. One method is to create simulated user prompts or tasks and have a set of expected outcomes (like unit tests). Another is to run ablations – disable a certain tool or memory and see if performance drops, to understand its contribution. There’s also crowd or user feedback for subjective aspects: e.g., how “helpful” or “pleasant” was the agent. As Chip Huyen notes, agent evaluation might involve measuring the frequency of certain failure mode ([Agents](https://huyenchip.com/2025/01/07/agents.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L943%20Evaluation%20is,Some%20of)) ([Agents](https://huyenchip.com/2025/01/07/agents.html#:~:text=To%20evaluate%20an%20agent%2C%20identify,of%20these%20failure%20modes%20happens))】. For example, measure how often the agent chooses an incorrect tool (planning failure) by constructing specific prompts that require using a particular tool. Over time, as you fix bugs, these metrics should improve.

## Future Directions

The field of LLM agents is evolving rapidly. Here are some **future directions and trends** that are likely to shape the next year or two:

- **Multi-Agent Coordination and Society:** We’re likely to see more advanced forms of agents working together. Beyond two agents chatting, imagine **swarms of agents** handling parts of a task and coordinating. There’s interest in _agent organizations_ – e.g., an agent “manager” hires and fires other sub-agents as needed, or a marketplace of agents that can bid to take on a task. This introduces questions: how do agents communicate efficiently (there may be protocol developments like Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) to standardize thi ([A Visual Guide to LLM Agents - by Maarten Grootendorst](https://newsletter.maartengrootendorst.com/p/a-visual-guide-to-llm-agents#:~:text=6))】)? How to avoid chaos with many agents (maybe an explicit coordinator or using RL to train cooperation strategies)? The Generative Agents paper (Park et al. 2023) gave a glimpse of believable multi-agent simulation (agents in a sandbox town ([A Visual Guide to LLM Agents - by Maarten Grootendorst](https://newsletter.maartengrootendorst.com/p/a-visual-guide-to-llm-agents#:~:text=Interactive%20Simulacra%20of%20Human%20Behavior)) ([A Visual Guide to LLM Agents - by Maarten Grootendorst](https://newsletter.maartengrootendorst.com/p/a-visual-guide-to-llm-agents#:~:text=Annoted%20figure%20of%20the%20Generative,Simulacra%20of%20Human%20Behavior%20paper))】 – future work might merge such simulations with utility-driven agents that can also perform useful work. There’s also the possibility of integrating agents with different specializations (a vision agent, a language agent, a robotics agent) to solve multi-modal tasks together.

- **Integration with Autonomous Systems & the Physical World:** Right now, most LLM agents operate in a digital environment (text, code, APIs). But connecting them to the _physical world_ is on the horizon. This means robotics (an agent controlling a robot via natural language or code), IoT devices, or even vehicles. Already we see projects where an LLM agent can control a drone or a home assistant device. This requires grounding – the agent needs to understand the real-world consequences of actions. It also raises safety stakes significantly (a mistake could cause physical harm). Future agents might incorporate feedback from sensors and operate under explicit safety constraints. We might also see standardized APIs for agents to interface with operating systems (somewhat like how voice assistants have OS integrations – e.g., Apple’s SiriKit – we might get “AgentKit” for desktop actions). OpenAI has hinted at such possibilities with their plugins architecture (which could extend to OS control). As these integrations deepen, the line between a software agent and a robotics control system will blur.

- **Improved Memory and Lifelong Learning:** Memory systems will become more sophisticated. Agents might build and maintain their own **knowledge graphs or long-term memory stores** over repeated sessions. Instead of treating each run as isolated, an agent could accumulate experiences. This bleeds into _lifelong learning_, where the agent refines its behavior over time without explicit retraining of the base model. We might see hybrids of retrieval-based memory and finetuning – e.g., an agent that periodically fine-tunes a smaller model on its interaction history to develop an “instinct” or specialized skill. Also, vector databases might evolve to be more agent-native, with built-in support for things like episodic memory queries (like retrieving sequences of events, not just similar chunks). There’s also work on _efficient context window use_, like dynamically compressing memory or using recurrence (some labs exploring recurrent transformers that can effectively have unbounded memory). All this to say, future agents should handle longer and more complex tasks due to better memory.

- **Better Planning and Reasoning Algorithms:** The current prompt-engineering based planning (ReAct, CoT, ToT) will likely be augmented or replaced by more robust _algorithmic planning_. For instance, integrating tree search algorithms with LLM-generated evaluations, or using **programmatic planning** where the agent generates a program (e.g., in a DSL) that the system then executes to perform the task. We might also see agents that can _self-verify_ plans before executing (like run a mental simulation). There’s research on combining LLMs with classical planners or solvers – for example, using an LLM to translate a problem into a formal representation, solve with a traditional algorithm, then translate back. In short, expect agents to get better at **“thinking ahead”**. The Tree-of-Thoughts and similar concepts might become more practical as compute improves or as models can do it internally. Also, frameworks might start offering multiple planning strategies out of the box – e.g., “use a BFS search style for this problem, use a depth-first for that”. It wouldn’t be surprising if an agent could adapt its planning approach based on the task (like recognizing a puzzle vs an open-ended task and switching strategy).

- **Reflexivity and Self-Monitoring:** Future agents will likely have more built-in self-monitoring. Today, Reflexion and Self-Refine are add-ons; tomorrow, we might expect any good agent to have a _reflexive loop_ where it’s constantly checking “am I on track? any errors to correct?”. This could be achieved by having the model itself trained to output not just an action, but also a confidence or a reflection after the action. Or by having a secondary model always critique the primary (an ensemble approach). The idea of an agent knowing its own limits and asking for help (maybe asking a human when truly stuck, or consulting a knowledge base on its own confusion) is a compelling one. OpenAI’s Assistant API (the one powering ChatGPT Plugins) has some aspects of this – e.g., the model can decline to answer or ask clarifying questions. Agents might extend that: e.g., if the agent realizes its plan isn’t working, it might _re-plan or escalate_ rather than blindly continuing. This kind of meta-reasoning is hard, but even partial progress would make agents more reliable.

- **Explicit vs Implicit Agency Boundaries:** Right now, giving an LLM “agency” is often done implicitly by just prompting it with an open-ended instruction (e.g. “You can do these things, now go forth.”). In the future, we might see more **explicit control over what an agent can and cannot do** – perhaps at the API level. For example, imagine being able to create an agent and explicitly set: allowed tools = {A, B}, budget = X, must get approval if trying Y. This would create clearer _boundaries_ for the agent’s autonomy. Frameworks could implement this by design – e.g., refusing an agent’s action if it’s out-of-policy. Implicit boundaries are what we do with system prompts (“Don’t do anything dangerous”), but explicit ones would be enforced by the system, not relying solely on the LLM to comply. This moves agents closer to how we treat software processes with permissions. Another aspect is **sandboxing decisions**: maybe an agent can propose an action plan but it won’t be executed until a user or a higher-level agent approves it (like a check-and-confirm step, adding a human-in-loop as a normal part of operation). Enterprises especially will want such controls, and frameworks will likely add them.

- **Standards and Interoperability:** As the agent ecosystem grows, there’s a need for standards so that tools and agents can work across frameworks. Anthropic’s **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is one attemp ([A Visual Guide to LLM Agents - by Maarten Grootendorst](https://newsletter.maartengrootendorst.com/p/a-visual-guide-to-llm-agents#:~:text=6))】, aiming to standardize how you provide context (like memory and goals) to different models/agents in a multi-agent system. OpenAI might come with their own approach via the Agents API. We might see an equivalent of “HTTP for agents” – a protocol where agents can communicate or a universal way to define a tool that any agent from any framework can use (somewhat like the LangChain standard, but more formal). This could also help in evaluation – standardized benchmarks and interfaces to run an agent on a test suite easily. Interoperability would also allow mixing components: e.g., use LangChain’s tool library with BeeAI’s orchestrator, etc., without writing glue code. Efforts like the GAIA benchmark and communities like Camel-AI’s are early steps toward this.

- **Larger Contexts and Memory via Model Upgrades:** On a more technology note, as models like GPT-4 get 100k or 1M token contexts, agents can possibly operate with much broader context windows, reducing need for complex memory management in some cases. If you can literally give the model _all_ relevant info in one go, the agent’s job simplifies to focusing on reasoning. We’ll see how reliably models handle those huge contexts, but it could make agents more capable – e.g., ingesting entire codebases for a coding agent or entire company wikis for a support agent. Additionally, if/when models become more fine-tunable or have plugin-like capabilities at training time, agents might be partly configured via model weights rather than pure prompting.

Overall, the trajectory is towards **more capable, more reliable, and more integrated agents**. We’re moving from gimmicky demos to systems that could become part of everyday software. But achieving that means solving the reliability and safety issues.

One can imagine in a few years, we might have something like an “AI App Store” where you download agent personas or workflows (somewhat like how we download apps) that can do various autonomous tasks for you. Each with verified capabilities and constraints. This will require standardized ways to describe what an agent can do and how safe it is – perhaps a “capabilities manifest”.

For now, as someone at the cutting edge, you can contribute to these directions: maybe you’ll implement a new reflection technique, or integrate an agent with a robot, or help define those standards. It’s an exciting time – agents feel like what web browsers were in the 90s: a bit wild, sometimes crashing, but full of potential to transform how we use computers.
